## About
Since custom VFX requires editing a single file in order to work in-game and only one can be installed at a time, mostly similar to the situation with venues, I've put together a community resource to avoid conflicts. I was already making one for my mods (converting everything from TS3/TSM, some animations/objects use unique VFX), then I realized others could use it too and we could avoid conflicts and confusion by maintaining a single resource instead. Note that it works similarly to XML Injector, mod users grab the latest version from the CurseForge (CF) download page that I will be hosting, while unlike XML Injector modders can submit their VFX here, to me via messaging, or request VFX to be converted or adjusted and then added to the main download.

Once the VFX has been added to this resource, make sure to link the downlad page in your mod description and/or set it as a dependency if uploading to CurseForge. If you originally had the VFX file included in your mod, make sure to remove it so you don't break anything!

## Download
This works like XML Injector, users _must_ download from the main download page. **Do not include the resource in your downloads!!** It will cause confusion and result in outdated files floating around if you do that.

## Submitting
You can either submit your regular VFX to me via messaging on any platform (recommended), or to this Git by following the instructions on the submission page. If you need a converted TS3/TSM VFX contact me to request it be added, which is recommended to avoid issues and because there are several guidelines to follow for conversions. Requests for alterations to existing VFX is also linked.

Note that NSFW related VFX is allowed but has to follow a few simple guidelines in order to be included, which you can find more details about on the Submitting page.

[Requesting Altered VFX](https://github.com/MizoreYukii/TS4-Custom-VFX-Resource/wiki/Requesting-Altered-VFX)

[Requesting Converted TS3/TSM VFX](https://github.com/MizoreYukii/TS4-Custom-VFX-Resource/wiki/Requesting-Converted-TS3-TSM-VFX) - Note: Like all the animations and functional objects from TS3/TSM, I will eventually have all VFX converted, so this page will be adjusted or removed when done.

[Submitting Converted TS3/TSM VFX](https://github.com/MizoreYukii/TS4-Custom-VFX-Resource/wiki/Submitting-Converted-TS3-or-TSM-VFX) - Note: If for some reason you are doing this yourself (please let me know before you do to avoid issues and conflicts), please follow the instructions exactly. Like all the animations and functional objects from TS3/TSM, I will eventually have all VFX converted, so this page will be adjusted or removed when done.

## Updates
Since I will be hosting the download I will also handle patch related updates, which if EA doesn't change anything drastic should be simply opening the VFX and re-saving after the VFX tool updates. You can of course do this yourself as well and submit another pull request, but check the Git first to make sure it wasn't already done.

If you are making changes to your custom files after submission for whatever reason, please make sure to list the reason in the pull. Also, please avoid altering people's custom VFX or the converted VFX without at least first contacting the creators (converted contact to me), or instead clone them rather than a direct change (with permission). Alterations without notice could cause problems for the original reasons they were made. Any alterations to someone's work or converted TS3/TSM VFX without prior notice and approval will not be accepted.

## How to Use the VFX
Works like EA VFX when referencing, find the name of the VFX you want in the CustomVFXList.txt, then copy and paste it's name in the appropriate spot.

If you need to preview the VFX, install the main download like a normal mod and then download [Andrew's VFX player](https://sims4studio.com/post/43316). Note that in some rare cases a VFX (custom or EA) seems like it might not play, but so far this seems to be because they are above or below the normal sims environment. You may need to install a camera mod to zoom out far enough to see them. (Thanks to Pancake for helping narrow that down.)

## Contact/Help
If you need help with making VFX, using VFX, or making a mod/poses/CC item in general, please go to the creator server **[Creator Musings](https://discord.gg/qxz5Kn5)** where I or other creators may be able to help. It's a server I made for CC creators, posers/animators, and modders of all types to receive help, find tutorials/resources, and hang out with each other. You also do not need to be a creator to join, as everyone is welcome.

If you need to contact me to submit/request a VFX or report an issue, you can do so on any of my social media listed. Discord is the fastest way to reach me though as I am always active there, and if you are in Creator Musings (which hopefully you are!) you can just ping me in the server.
